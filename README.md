Trying out making some games using [phaser.io](https://phaser.io/).

This is a monorepo (built with turbo repo), with a handful of games
* Marco Maker
* Bullet Hell
* Simon Says
* Waves
* Network
* Game Template

Nothing special, mostly learning. Games available at https://phaser-games-kohl.vercel.app/
